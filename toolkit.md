## Tools Used

Here are the tools I use on a regular basis, and were used in the development of this project

### Editing Tools

**Notepad++** : <https://notepad-plus-plus.org/>

This is my **primary** editor, and I've been using it for quite a number of years. It has a lot of features and I use most of them on a regular basis. I've tried other editors but found them to be lacking in regards to the features I use. For example in Notepad++ I use :

**Markdown Edit** : <http://markdownedit.com/>

A handy program to have for editing *markdown* files. I've tried a number of them and this one works best for **Git** style markdown files. I also use it for *Bitbucket* markdown, but should be noted that Git and Bitbucket are slightly different in regards to the markdown that's recognized. 

### File Grep and File Search

**AstroGrep** : <http://astrogrep.sourceforge.net/>

Anyone who has been working in *Linux* (*or Unix for some of us "old timers"*) you have probably use the command-line utility `grep`. It is useful, but a *gui* version is so much better! And that's what this is. It's a GUI grep tool with the ability to tie in to your editor. For example you can configure *AstroGrep* to open a found file in your editor *on the line* you've double-clicked on in the results pane.

**Windows Search**: Admittedly, definitely **not** the best. But it works. If I find a better file search I'll be sure to note it here.

### File Difference and Merge

**Winmerge** : <http://winmerge.org/>

What's the *difference*? Being able to see the differences between two source files can mean the difference between finding the bug quickly or potentially taking a real long time. 

This application will allow you to edit or copy changes from one file to another. It can also be used to compare the contents of a folder against another. 

#### Version Control

**Gitkraken** : <https://www.gitkraken.com/>

This is my favorite Git UI tool. It works perfectly for Github and Bitbucket. It's free for non-commercial use. And it also runs on Mac and Linux.

### IDE Software

**Visual Studio Code** : <https://code.visualstudio.com/>

Very helpful with debugging JavaScript on Node.

### API Testers

**Postman** : <https://www.getpostman.com/>

If you do *any kind* of API work this tool is indispensable. 

### HTTP Servers

For normal operations I will be *hosting* the Node and the client applications on a NAS. But for development and testing I'm using a *web server application* to host the client files.

**XAMPP** : <https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html>
